# Biography

I am currently a Lecturer in School of Computer Science and Cyber Engineering, Guangzhou University (GZHU). I received my Ph.D. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), advised by Prof. [Jiahai Wang](http://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2551). My Chinese hompage at GZHU is [here](http://jsj.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1208/3501.htm).

# Research Interests

I am broadly interested in graph learning, including graph neural networks and graph representation learning. Currently, I design graph learning methods for multi-agent systems in the cyber, physical, and social space of smart cities, e.g., urban traffic systems and online social networks. For urban traffic systems, I aim to reveal how interactions of individuals at the microscopic level lead to the emergence of intelligence at the macroscopic level. For online social networks, I try to link accounts belonging to the same person across different social networks, a.k.a. user identity linkage, so that user information can be integrated for more comprehensive urban sensing and computing. My current research is summarized in the following figure.
